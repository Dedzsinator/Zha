REMOVED (Not Actually Implemented):
❌ Multi-head attention detailed derivations (uses standard PyTorch)
❌ Full HMM algorithms (Forward, Viterbi, Baum-Welch) - uses hmmlearn
❌ Pitch class vectors and interval vectors (not in the actual implementation)
❌ Information-theoretic measures (entropy, mutual information, cross-entropy)
❌ Memory coalescing details (not explicitly implemented)
❌ Mathematical chord template similarity (not in the code)
